        <h1 class="h1"> Movie Review: Cinderella </h1>
        <p> oh, i guess we're doing these now </p>
        
        <br>

        <p> so disclaimer here: i don't actually watch a lot of movies? so if you think my rating doesn't match the IMDb or rotten tomatoes rating, it's because my taste in movies is extremely niche and i don't want anyone to just rely on my "review" to decide on whether to watch a movie; these are just my thoughts and they most probably won't match yours, or the majority's thoughts. pls dont @me, i just wanna enjoy my movies </p>
        <p> unlike me and my reluctance to watch movies, my parents watch any random movie they can find, so the living room always has some or the other movie going on in it. </p>
        <p> usually it's one of those hallmark movies, which are all the same; some love story going on in the background of some business-related work, all set around christmas. i don't like those, so i'm never gnna watch them or review them. </p>
        <h2> But yesterday, they started watching Cinderella, and I was intrigued. </h2> 
        
        <br>
        
        <p> so i stood in my usual spot: just outside the living room, leaning against a wall, in sight of the TV; and i started watching the movie. </p>
        <p> now usually i would click off the moment i see modern slangs in a movie, but this one was supposed to be family friendly, so i wondered how they would try to make it "hip" while keeping it family friendly, and looked on. </p>        
        <p> you know how netflix has been trying to make their shows more "hip" and it always ends up looking like a product of bean counters not knwoing what they're doing, because that's what was happening? long ago, when i stopped getting entertained by newly relased movies, i never thought i would say this, but i gotta give them credit where credit's due:</p>
        <h2> Amazon's nailed it. </h2>
        
        <br>
        
        <p> lemme explain what i mean. </p>
        <p> i may or may not agree with the decision of taking on Camilla Cabello as lead cast, but then her singing talent (even though i don't like her songs at all) is certainly better than Emma Watson, who was still taken for Beauty and the Beast, because, well, she's Emma Watson. </p>
        <p> so although this shouldn't even be a thing one should have to wish for in a musical, but at they did take actual vocalists for cast. </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p> as for the modernisation of the language, well people do that all the time; the bible wasn't originally in english, was it? things keep getting adapted and changed, so simply not trying it becuse it's different isn't the best way to approach new things. and i really liked how they changed it. i mean yeah it does assume you know the original story, so i guess that makes it lose a few points; but it allows for 4th wall breaks that made me laugh quite a bit, without making me feel embarrassed to be watching the movie, or worse, making me cringe. </p>
        
        <p> the dynamic with the kind being unable to participate in the musicals was also not bad (i didn't particularly love it, but it did add something to the movie and it won't be the same without that dynamic) </p>
        
        <p> i felt like the announcer sections were really good, but then that's like saying mumble rap is music, so screw my tastes don't trust what i say please or you'll regret it i need to stop this sentence right about now </p>
        
        <p> now, for the most controversial thing. </p>
