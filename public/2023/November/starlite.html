<h2 id="time-for-a-computer-update-↩︎">Time for a computer update. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h2>
<p>I actually have a lot of hardware on my hands, all of which have had interesting stories; however, i'll list them briefly here, because this post is only about one of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>le shitbox, that is now a "new" computer with almost everything changed - it has a Core-i7 3770, a definitely-not-repurposed h61 chipset running a smaller-than-micro-ATX motherboard, 16 gigs of DDR3 @ 1600 MHz, a 500 gig Crucial MX500 SSD as a boot drive, and the old hard drive (finally relieved of its boot duty) as extra storage.</li>
<li>A (relatively) powerful workstation, with a ryzen 7 1700, slotted in an MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (no idea why the sudden all-caps is necessary), with 40 gigs (long story) of DDR4 @ 3200 MHz, a 240 gig WD green SATA M.2 SSD for boot drive, 2 terabytes of hard drive goodness, and most importantly an utterly overbuilt GTX 1660 Super (which lets me turn the fans off whenever I'm not using it thanks to the ridiculously large heatsink).</li>
<li>My laptop, that the rest of this post is about.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ive-always-been-more-of-a-desktop-person-↩︎">I've always been more of a desktop person. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h2>
<p>Desktops have been what I've used for my entire life, and they fulfill almost all of my needs from a computer: A device that computes, while maintaining a clear boundary between when i'm using it and when i'm not (which helps with focusing on work); It's versatile, taking up most of my visual cone with everything I may need while using it; and it simply felt flexible (with good peripherals, and a silent environment).</p>
<h3 id="laptops-simply-werent-the-same-↩︎">Laptops simply weren't the same. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>I'm from a family with a very tiny budget for computers; at our budget, laptops were small, thick, hot, loud, slow machines with terrible screens, terrible trackpads, a battery life that made the old UPS in my house look good in comparison, and the "portability" simply didn't feel worth the other compromises (and extra price).</p>
<p>To get a laptop that came anywhere close to feature-parity with a budget desktop, we used to look at anywhere from a 50% to a 100% increase in requisite budget; this simply wasn't doable with our financial condition. And so we kept using desktops. </p>
<h3 id="things-changed-when-i-decided-to-go-to-college-↩︎">Things changed when I decided to go to college. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>When we looked at the dorm room, it turned out to be extremely tiny (I don't remember the exact size but it was under 50 sqft), and I had to live there with a roommate.</p>
<p>Obviously, I wasn't fitting a desktop in that tiny a space. So I had to start looking for a laptop.</p>
<p>however, one doesn't just start looking for a new device willy-nilly:</p>
<h2 id="i-had-to-figure-out-what-i-use-a-computer-for-↩︎">I had to figure out what I use a computer for. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h2>
<p>well then, what <em>do</em> I do with a computer?</p>
<p>Time to figure out:</p>
<h3 id="my-use-case-↩︎">My use-case. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>I use a computer for an alarmingly large number of hours a day, with a lot of my time being spent inside a web browser <del>like most people</del>. </p>
<p>However, I don't watch video content on computers, preferring my smartphone as a more portable (and better quality) display for video.</p>
<p>I do like taking video using a camcorder or pictures with a camera, but i'm not professional and I only use these devices to record memories.</p>
<p>I like open-source software, so I'd like to use linux if possible.</p>
<p>Continuing on open-source software, a lot of software I use (like Left or Lite XL) needs to be compiled or built for use, so I will be running the odd small compile job.</p>
<p>I do like playing videogames from time-to-time but I have a desktop that can handle them well and so any other machine doesn't need to be able to run them.</p>
<p>I know the lack of posts here suggests otherwise, but I do a lot of writing on computers. (it's only a matter of time before i drain my bank account building my own keyboard)</p>
<p>That was a lot of stuff, so to summarize; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do web browsing (but the text kind, not the video kind), I do some regular people stuff (minimal photo and video management), I prefer open-source software even if it means i have to compile some of it, I  already have a machine for the occasional videogame, and I do a lot of writing (fun fact: i'm actually alternating between my desktop and my laptop to type this post out).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armed with this information, I now had to decide what parts of a laptop I need to spend more money on.</p>
<p>Or, in other words,</p>
<h3 id="prioritization-↩︎">Prioritization. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>I may not watch videos, but I do a lot of text work, so a display with a high pixel density is necessary. (high resolution is the obvious way of doing this, but you'll see later why I mentioned high pixel density specifically).</p>
<p>text work also necessitates a good keyboard (long travel, good key stabilization, easily recognisable layout, backlit).</p>
<p>I would use this laptop on the go, so it has to be as small as possible; I have to fit it in whatever i can carry while on the go at short notice.</p>
<p>portability, however, shouldn't come at the cost of battery life. At minimum 6 hours, with 8 hours or more being nice to have.</p>
<p>because of the restriction with portability at short notice, the trackpad should be serviceable enough to not need a mouse (at least until I learn keyboard navigation).</p>
<p>Having as little moving parts as necessary would be nice in outdoors use, becuase the less there is, the less there is to fail. <br>
also I happen to be a bit of a silence freak, and previous experience with laptops makes me averse to having fans on one.</p>
<p>Linux compatibility is necessary, and i'm ready to pay extra (within reason) for it.</p>
<p>well then, what did i end up choosing?</p>
<h3 id="as-it-turns-out-nobody-sells-tiny-laptops-in-my-country-↩︎">As it turns out, nobody sells tiny laptops in my country. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>Even worse, none of the laptops I could see at a reasonable price had a functional BIOS, let alone driver and ACPI compatibility with linux.</p>
<h3 id="i-decided-to-check-out-laptop-manufacturers-that-make-linux-laptops-↩︎">I decided to check out laptop manufacturers that make linux laptops. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>here's how the list goes, in order of me discovering of their existence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dell, Lenovo: these guys do offer linux support on <em>some</em> of their devices, but mostly for ones that are extremely out of budget, and are usually overpowered for my use-case. Dell, interestingly, had some models that were fitting within the upper limits of my budget, but they had terrible 1366x768 displays (why?), booted off of hard drives (WHY?) had terrible battery life, awful trackpads and whiny fans (they did have old 8th gen intel laptop CPUs as well, but they're also frankly overkill for my use-case). They hadn't changed a tiny bit from my nightmare imagination of laptops from 2012.</li>
<li>Systen76: anyone who has spent any amount of time on YouTube would know LTT, and their <del>obsession</del> interest in Pop_OS! and System76. So, I decided to look at their offerings.<br><br> their offerings <em>started</em> at $999. <br> Good thing they don't ship to my country, I would've felt worse if they did.</li>
<li>Slimbook: These guys <em>do</em> seem to ship to India, and they also have good reputation with the community. However, their cheapest offering, while nowhere near as expensive as System76, is still slightly above my paygrade at 569€ without shipping, and for some reason that doesn't include a power brick? <br> I would've gone with slimbook if they had an offering with everything else being of similar quality except for a less powerful CPU to make a cheaper version, and if they included a power brick in the price. But they don't, so oh well.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4 id="note-↩︎">Note. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h4>
<p>At this point in my research, I was beginning to notice a pattern: major manufacturers were still making te kind of laptop I hate at the pricepoint I needed: Put in a powerful CPU, and compromise everything else; meanwhile, boutique manufacturers were going for a no-compromises experience, at the cost of, well, cost.</p>
<p>This meant if I wanted a laptop that was properly cheap (and not a chromebook, since those weren't in stock in the entire country back when I wanted to buy my laptop), I would need to try much, much harder.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Pine64: The Pinebook Pro piqued my interest since the moment I saw it. Here was a laptop that was trying to offer almost everything (except for a weak ARM CPU) for an accessible price. Since all i'll be doing is a bunch of writing and learning C/Lua/Rust (and maybe contribute to small OSS projects I use like Lite XL), an ARM CPU that's more powerful than a raspberry pi 4 (if only by a little bit) would be perfect. The 4 gigs of RAM would be slightly problematic for using firefox the way my workstation has spoiled me into; but that's nothing a little restraint can't fix. <br> Unfortunately, one thing that can't be fixed is the fact that when I entered my address into their website, they informed me they can't ship to my country because of "logistical issues". Oh well. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Starlabs Systems: Opening up the website immediately redirected me to the Indian version, which meant they ship to India and accept indian currency. This was already good news, but then I saw the Starlite Mk IV on their website, and it looked really good; even better, it perfectly fit in my budget (around $400 incl. taxes), and even with the high shipping cost included it was just under my budget (approximately $560).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I've bought the Starlabs Starlite Mk IV (this name is quite the mouthful).</p>
<h2 id="ive-named-my-laptop-minuto-↩︎">I've named my laptop Minuto. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h2>
<p>I usually name my devices what I do based on my first impression of them. Shitbox was called what it was because, well, it was not very good at its job of being a computer. My workstation is called Caldo because the ryzen 7 1700 in it really doesn't like being overclocked for games, and it used to heat up my entire room before I got an AC to calm that beast.</p>
<p>This laptop is called minuto, because it's tiny. </p>
<h3 id="size-↩︎">Size. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>How tiny? it has an 11.6" screen (bigger than a footlong but smaller than astolfo), along with humourously chonky bezels (the sides are fine, but the top and bottom make me wonder if this was built for a 16:10 screen and when adapted for 16:9, probably as a cost-cutting measure).</p>
<h3 id="display-↩︎">Display. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of, the display is surprisingly good for what I paid: it's 1080p, has a matte surface, gets decently bright outdoors as long as you don't have direct sunlight falling on the screen (i'm currently writing this outdoors during a winter afternoon, and at half brightness this is perfectly useable; full brightness is certainly nice but I wouldn't do that to save on battery life), is decently color accurate, and has fairly good pixel response for a 60Hz panel (and I wouldn't want any more to save on battery life).</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-↩︎">Keyboard. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>The keyboard is really nice to type on. I can't claim to know what makes a good keyboard good, but I can see if this matches my requirements, and it does: the key travel is much longer than many laptops i've tried in the past, and more importantly, the keycap stabilization is surprisingly good (it's fairly average for most keys, but the wider ones seem to be better stabilized, meaning the manufacturer probably tried to fix the worst offenders and only the worst offenders in order to cut costs while still delivering an acceptable typing experience), the keys are backlit (!) and the backlight is adjustable between two levels (!!!).</p>
<p>Now, that isn't to say everything is good with the keyboard: as I mentioned, the less wide the key is, the worse the keycap stabilization (the L-shaped enter key [my laptop came with a UK keyboard layout], being the thinnest key, has the worst stabilization near the bottom right corner); the keyboard layout is <em>ever so slightly</em> cramped thanks to the pseudo-12-inch nature of it, and the backlight never really turns off: it stays turned on at a very low brightness (which is noticeable in a dark room at night), and although it helps with my night-owl habits, it does mean that this is one place where battery life could've been made better.</p>
<h3 id="trackpad-↩︎">Trackpad. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>It's nothing to write home about, but it's pretty fairly sized for the size of laptop that it's in, it doesn't make me feel like my fingers are drunk, and it detects gestures that work with linux, so it's good enough for me to not want to carry a mouse everywhere I go.</p>
<h3 id="webcam-and-microphone-↩︎">Webcam and microphone. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>This, unfortunately, is something where I got what I paid for: the webcam is <em>just barely</em> good enough when I'm outside like I am right now, but the moment you go indoors it's simply not able to handle the lack of light <em>even with</em> the terrible excuse of a studio lighting setup I have made at my desk for online meetings. </p>
<p>The mic is somehow even worse: there seems to be a stereo microphone setup, but it's very bad at picking up my noises, and very good at picking up the keyboard's noises. Unlike the webcam, there's no scenario in which I will ever be able to rely on the microphone (outside of <a href="https://github.com/ideasman42/nerd-dictation">nerd-dictation</a>, which is a really useful project, checck it out).</p>
<p>Thankfully, I bought a logitech c270 for using with Caldo, and although it doesn't work nearly as well for my laptop, it's a significant enough improvement over the built-in webcam (and a night-and-day difference against the built-in mic) that if I know I won't be able to access Caldo when an important meeting is about to happen, I'll make sure to have the C270 in my bag.</p>
<h3 id="speakers-↩︎">Speakers. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>They don't get too loud unfortunately, and there doesn't seem to be any obvious holes in the body for the sound to come out; I simply pair my bluetooth earbuds to listen to music, and that works fine. </p>
<h3 id="body-↩︎">Body. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>It's a surprisingly thin laptop (so thin it has to bulge out for USB type A the way old thin laptops used to for ethernet), but it's also suprisingly heavy given the size thanks to an aluminium body instead of plastic. I however, don't care much about the weight, since it's still lighter than other laptops and more importantly it feels nice to hold. </p>
<p>That niceness does come at a very high cost: for some reason, every single material that this laptop is made of is an absolute fingerprint magnet. Even my mother's bone-dry hands leave fingerprints on this that are difficult to clean, and so my extremely oily hands leave this laptop absolutely drenched in oil every single time I use it; everything from the body to the bezels, from the keycaps to the trackpad gets oily. I don't like this at all, but I don't know how to overcome this. If I have any major complaints about this laptop, it's this.</p>
<h3 id="ports--↩︎">Ports.  <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>This being a thin, tiny and cheap modern-day laptop, it doesn't have a lot of ports unfortunately. </p>
<p>on the right (listing ports back to front), there's barrel plug for power, 3.5mm jack (which looks very similar to the barrel jack right beside it, so it's a nightmare to plug the charger in the dark), USB 3 type-A port, and a microSD slot.</p>
<p>On the left, there's a USB 3 type-C port with power delivery, which I use with a dongle to connect switch my desk setup between Caldo and Minuto while using a single port; beside it, theres micro-HDMI (which is a really sad inclusion; seriously guys, mini-displayport or even just type-C with displayport out would've been better) which is very difficult to use, and for some reason also sparks when i'm trying to plug a micro-HDMI cable in? I don't think that's intended behaviour but I'm too tired to deal with micro-HDMI any more than I <em>have</em> to for using this laptop "docked" to my desk (poor man's laptop dock is a flat surface with many cables, which in my case is the perforated top of Caldo, helps with cooling); beyond that is another USB 3 type-A port.</p>
<p>That's about it for physical connectivity. The laptop does support ac Wi-Fi, which is a nice inclusion especially because that's the only way it has to connect to a network.</p>
<p>It also does bluetooth, which I use for bluetooth audio (because that's the only place I use bluetooth in my everyday life).</p>
<p>Time to talk about the internals of the laptop, and let me first begin with a disclaimer:</p>
<h4 id="the-internals-arent-upgradeable-on-this-laptop-outside-of-storage-↩︎">The internals aren't upgradeable on this laptop outside of storage. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h4>
<p>That by itself may be a very big deal-breaker to many, and I understand. A device like this will simply fall behind because software tends to get heavier on both processing and memory over time.</p>
<p>However, I simply intend to use this as a portable writing device, and looking at the slowdown of moore's law (and the fact that if things go well, i'll eventually be using tools i write myself, thus being able to control how performant it is on my hardware), I can be fairly confident that I will be using the hardware of this laptop in one form or another for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Now that that's out of the way, we can properly talk about:</p>
<h3 id="the-internals-↩︎">The internals. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>This laptop is powered by an Intel Pentium Silver N5030, which is a quad-core Gemini Lake chip with a base clock of 1.1 GHz and a maximum boost clock of 3.1 GHz. </p>
<p>Now Gemini Lake might make many people feel uneasy; isn't that lineup of silicon the inheritor of the unpopular Atom architecture?</p>
<p>Well, yes; However, these devices have gotten significantly more powerful in the past few years, and this 6W low-power chip performs esentially like an i5 6500T but severely power-starved.</p>
<p>That is, however, when the chip is completely unlocked.</p>
<p>usually, there's power and thermal constraints on this chip, and this laptop was very clearly designed with those constraints in mind.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-a-fanless-laptop-↩︎">This is a fanless laptop, <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h3>
<p>and that has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's completely silent, because of a lack of moving parts.</li>
<li>due to a lack of large openings with lots of airflow, dust ingress is significantly slower, and that's particularly helpful in an exceedingly dusty area like mine.</li>
<li>there's no fan to fail and make the laptop cook itself, and thus a lack of moving parts can help with longevity.</li>
<li>There's another kind of longevity this helps with: Fans do use up power to run, you know. No fans, lower power draw.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this is never gonna be all sunshine and rainbows, otherwise every laptop on the planet would be fanless. (unless Frore Systems is able to bring AirJet to market in a financially relevant manner, that is but a pipe dream)</p>
<p>So time to tackle the compromise you're making going fanless.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of a fan is to cool the heat-generating elements of a laptop. If you don't have a fan, the only way left to cool (currently) is passive cooling; also called heating up the body of the laptop until it radiates all its heat away. The fact that this laptop has an aluminium body is a double-edged sword: It takes heat away from the CPU and spreads it across the body of the laptop, improving cooling, but then the laptop has a tendency of burning your skin, which is less than ideal. I do have this problem under control now, but that will come in a different section.</li>
<li>Because of a fanless design, you're not only thermally limited, but you're also power-limnited; what that means is that performance is going to be, frankly, pretty terrible for a lot of things. Thankfully, that isn't a problem for me because i'm not using this for anything compute-heavy when i'm away from the wall; again, more details will be in a different section.</li>
</ul>
<br>
What else do i need to talk about now?

<p>oh yes, i forgot about</p>
<h2 id="linux-↩︎">Linux. <a href="#index">↩︎</a></h2>
<p>One of the reasons I bought this laptop was because linux support was guaranteed, and it came with linux set up out of the box.</p>
<p>I did have the option to choose what distribution I would want installed, but my cart bugged out the first time, and I forgot to choose a different distribution the second time; hence, I ended up with plain old Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="ubuntu-isnt-great">Ubuntu isn't great.</h3>
<p>I should probably have written a separate post on this, but then that also applies to every topic in this nightmarishly long post, so oh well</p>
<p>Ubuntu is a linux distribution that comes with everything set out of the box for ease of use. It uses a slightly customised version of Gnome and is something a lot of people use to breathe life into older devices.</p>
<br>
One small issue, this laptop is weaker than older devices.

<p>this unfortunately means that Gnome performed terribly, chewed through battery life and made this laptop run concerningly hot.</p>
<p>As one would expect, I first thought this is a power usage issue which linux is known to not do well out of the box, so i decided to install <code>tlp</code>.</p>
<p><code>tlp</code> helped with the battery and the heating a bit, but after a while of use it was clear that gnome was simply too much for the poor gemini lake chip inside this to handle, and it had to go.</p>
<h3 id="changing-out-gnome-should-be-easy">Changing out Gnome should be easy,</h3>
<p>but that's assuming you know what you're doing. I don't.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to try out KDE, because KDE has been getting much lighter in recent years, and is apparently as light as xfce.</p>
<p>I did find that to be the case for memory, but it still took significantly more processing power to run; the laptop never really went under 50% CPU usage, and the battery life was still kinda bad.</p>
<p>KDE looked good, but we can't afford to look good where we're going with this laptop.</p>
<h3 id="xfce-did-run-better-but-not-without-its-compromises">Xfce did run better, but not without its compromises.</h3>
<p>suspend doesn't work nearly as well, thanks to which the battery life was even worse, and <code>xfwm</code> was simply not efficient enough to run well on this hardware.</p>
<p>So, I replaced the window manager with Openbox and the compositor with <code>picom</code>, which performs better while providing better shadows (and because I have to launch <code>picom</code> whenever I need it, it's not always running in the background when I don't need it, for example while typing this out in fullscreen).</p>
<p>and hey, my laptop finally idles! (as long as we agree that idling means the CPU is under 5% when not doing anything)</p>
<h3 id="idling-fixed-next-stop-boot-time">idling fixed, next stop: boot time.</h3>
<p>Despite having an SSD, the laptop took over 30 seconds to boot linux, which isn't what one would expect from a "lightweight" operating system.</p>
