<p>And I've been using a fairly interesting one for a year now.</p>

<p>I actually have a lot of hardware on my hands, all of which have had interesting stories; however, i'll list them briefly here, because this post is only about one of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>le shitbox, that is now a "new" computer with almost everything changed - it has a Core-i7 3770, a definitely-not-repurposed h61 chipset running a smaller-than-micro-ATX motherboard, 16 gigs of DDR3 @ 1600 MHz, a 500 gig Crucial MX500 SSD as a boot drive, andthe old hard drive (finally relieved of is boot duty) as extra storage.</li>
<li>A (relatively) powerful workstation, with a ryzen 7 1700, slotted in an MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (no idea why the sudden all-caps is necessay)</li>
