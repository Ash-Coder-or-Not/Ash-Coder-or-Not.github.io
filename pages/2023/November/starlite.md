# Laptops are a portable form of computing,

And I've been using a fairly interesting one for a year now.

## First, time for a computer update.

I actually have a lot of hardware on my hands, all of which have had interesting stories; however, i'll list them briefly here, because this post is only about one of them:

1. le shitbox, that is now a "new" computer with almost everything changed - it has a Core-i7 3770, a definitely-not-repurposed h61 chipset running a smaller-than-micro-ATX motherboard, 16 gigs of DDR3 @ 1600 MHz, a 500 gig Crucial MX500 SSD as a boot drive, and the old hard drive (finally relieved of its boot duty) as extra storage.
2. A (relatively) powerful workstation, with a ryzen 7 1700, slotted in an MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (no idea why the sudden all-caps is necessary), with 40 gigs (long story) of DDR4 @ 3200 MHz, a 240 gig WD green SATA M.2 SSD for boot drive, 2 terabytes of hard drive goodness, and most importantly an utterly overbuilt GTX 1660 Super (which lets me turn the fans off whenever I'm not using it thanks to the ridiculously large heatsink).
3. My laptop, that the rest of this post is about.

## I've always been more of a desktop person.

Desktops have been what I've used for my entire life, and they fulfill almost all of my needs from a computer: A device that computes, while maintaining a clear boundary between when i'm using it and when i'm not (which helps with focusing on work); It's versatile, taking up most of my visual cone with everything I may need while using it; and it simply felt flexible (with good peripherals, and a silent environment).

### Laptops simply weren't the same.

I'm from a family with a very tiny budget for computers; at our budget, laptops were small, thick, hot, loud, slow machines with terrible screens, terrible trackpads, a battery life that made the old UPS in my house look good in comparison, and the "portability" simply didn't feel worth the other compromises (and extra price).

To get a laptop that came anywhere close to feature-parity with a budget desktop, we used to look at anywhere from a 50% to a 100% increase in requisite budget; this simply wasn't doable with our financial condition. And so we kept using desktops. 

### Things changed when I decided to go to college.

When we looked at the dorm room, it turned out to be extremely tiny (I don't remember the exact size but it was under 50 sqft), and I had to live there with a roommate.

Obviously, I wasn't fitting a desktop in that tiny a space. So I had to start looking for a laptop.

however, one doesn't just start looking for a new device willy-nilly:
 
## I had to figure out what I use a computer for.

well then, what _do_ I do with a computer?

Time to figure out:

### My use-case.

I use a computer for an alarmingly large number of hours a day, with a lot of my time being spent inside a web browser ~~like most people~~. 

However, I don't watch video content on computers, preferring my smartphone as a more portable (and better quality) display for video.

I do like taking video using a camcorder or pictures with a camera, but i'm not professional and I only use these devices to record memories.

I like open-source software, so I'd like to use linux if possible.

Continuing on open-source software, a lot of software I use (like Left or Lite XL) needs to be compiled or built for use, so I will be running the odd small compile job.

I do like playing videogames from time-to-time but I have a desktop that can handle them well and so any other machine doesn't need to be able to run them.

I know the lack of posts here suggests otherwise, but I do a lot of writing on computers. (it's only a matter of time before i drain my bank account building my own keyboard)

That was a lot of stuff, so to summarize; 

> I do web browsing (but the text kind, not the video kind), I do some regular people stuff (minimal photo and video management), I prefer open-source software even if it means i have to compile some of it, I  already have a machine for the occasional videogame, and I do a lot of writing (fun fact: i'm actually alternating between my desktop and my laptop to type this post out).

Armed with this information, I now had to decide what parts of a laptop I need to spend more money on.

Or, in other words,

### Prioritization.

I may not watch videos, but I do a lot of text work, so a display with a high pixel density is necessary. (high resolution is the obvious way of doing this, but you'll see later why I mentioned high pixel density specifically).

text work also necessitates a good keyboard (long travel, good key stabilization, easily recognisable layout, backlit).

I would use this laptop on the go, so it has to be as small as possible; I have to fit it in whatever i can carry while on the go at short notice.

portability, however, shouldn't come at the cost of battery life. At minimum 6 hours, with 8 hours or more being nice to have.

because of the restriction with portability at short notice, the trackpad should be serviceable enough to not need a mouse (at least until I learn keyboard navigation).

Having as little moving parts as necessary would be nice in outdoors use, becuase the less there is, the less there is to fail. <br>
also I happen to be a bit of a silence freak, and previous experience with laptops makes me averse to having fans on one.

Linux compatibility is necessary, and i'm ready to pay extra (within reason) for it.


well then, what did i end up choosing?

### As it turns out, nobody sells tiny laptops in my country.

Even worse, none of the laptops I could see at a reasonable price had a functional BIOS, let alone driver and ACPI compatibility with linux.

### I decided to check out laptop manufacturers that make linux laptops.
