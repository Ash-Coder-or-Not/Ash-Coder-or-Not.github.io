# Laptops are a portable form of computing

And I've been using a fairly interesting one for a year now.

## First, time for a computer update.

I actually have a lot of hardware on my hands, all of which have had interesting stories; however, i'll list them briefly here, because this post is only about one of them:

1. le shitbox, that is now a "new" computer with almost everything changed - it has a Core-i7 3770, a definitely-not-repurposed h61 chipset running a smaller-than-micro-ATX motherboard, 16 gigs of DDR3 @ 1600 MHz, a 500 gig Crucial MX500 SSD as a boot drive, and the old hard drive (finally relieved of its boot duty) as extra storage.
2. A (relatively) powerful workstation, with a ryzen 7 1700, slotted in an MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX (no idea why the sudden all-caps is necessary), with 40 gigs (long story) of DDR4 @ 3200 MHz, a 240 gig WD green SATA M.2 SSD for boot drive, 2 terabytes of hard drive goodness, and most importantly an utterly overbuilt GTX 1660 Super (which lets me turn the fans off whenever I'm not using it thanks to the ridiculousy large heatsink).
3. My laptop, that the rest of this post is about.

## I've always been more of a desktop person.

Desktops have been what I've used for my entire life, and they fulfill almost all of my needs from a computer: A device that computes, while maintaining a clear boundary between when i'm using it and when i'm not (which helps with focusing on work)
