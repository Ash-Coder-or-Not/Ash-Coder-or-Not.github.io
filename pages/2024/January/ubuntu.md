# I've been using Ubuntu as my daily-driver for more than a year now,

And I'm not exactly loving this experience.

## At this point, you the reader falls into one of two camps.

You're either going "YEAH UBUNTU SUCKS LESGOOO" or you're going "Ubuntu? I've heard of it and know a couple of people that use it, what's so bad about it?"

However, I feel like this post of mine is for the second category of audience, and not the first. (mostly because past me was the second, and I don't think I'll ever want to be part of the first; despite me publishing these online, the primary audience for this is intended to be future me, and maybe whatever versiobn of past me still exists within future me)

Anyway, I need to start with the actual content of this ~~rant~~ post.

## Linux is a thing.

Yeah. I don't really know better to explain it, because Linux isn't an OS; it's a kernel, but the ecosystem is so much more than just the kernel that going full "GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux" feels pedantic.

So yeah. A thing. 

It's really nice to run servers on linux for me (haven't gotten into the world of BSDs quite yet), it's significantly less painful to try to set up C/C++, Python, Rust, or even Javascript environments on, and it's just really lightweight when you need to do something on very old hardware.

### With all those advantages, someone with prior experience using Linux would want to use a linux-based desktop environment for daily use.

That included me too, and I dabbled with desktop linux for years.

However, that would have a different article written for it, this one focuses solely on my ubuntu experience.

So, getting started, Ubuntu has two main versions of it: Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu Server, for desktop and server use respectively. (duh)

I'l talk about Ubuntu server first, since that was where I first started using Ubuntu, and desktop later, since I'm only using it now on my laptop `minuto`.

## Ubuntu Server.

I first ran into Ubuntu server all the way back in 2013, when a friend of mine in school thought he could mine bitcoin on a vista-era all-in-one PC he had and coulr get rich quick (some things never change), and wanted my help installing linux for the endeavour.

I (rather naively) never thought bitcoin would be a big thing despite really liking the math behind the cryptocurrency, because I felt like nobody would want to spend compute resources to keep a community-run currency afloat, that isn't backed by a government. 

I was wrong, but that's alright.

### Either way, the guy told me he needed something called ubuntu linux running on his system to get the maximum performance needed for the mining.

Now I was lucky enough to win a book about IT infrastructure through a quiz back in school, that talked aobut networking, windows server and something called Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

I didn't understand a lot of things in the book when I got it, but I got the gist of the matter; There's operating systems other than windows, used primarily by businesses to run workstations and servers, and they used something called Linux as their core, rather than NT for Windows.

Because this Ubuntu Linux thing had the word "Linux" in it as well, I assumed it would be fairly similar to use.

### oh how wrong was i

I went to his house, intending to download ubuntu on his computer because the download would still take forever on my recently-upgraded 5 Mb/s internet connection (until a year before, we were using literal dial-up on a pentium 4 system running windows XP, so while this was a huge jump for me, I did understand it was still far behind what was needed for some stuff).

When I got there, he told me he already had a boot drive ready using some new-fangled thing called rufus, and handed me a CD.

Since CDs can only hold 700 MB, i was wondering how he got ubuntu to fit on it (from trials at home, I had found out that ubuntu desktop was _just barely_ too large to fit on a CD).

The madlad thought I would be comfortable with text-mode, and had Ubuntu Server on that CD.

That was not a fun day, even if I look at it with rose-tinted glasses today and laugh.

Still, that baptism by fire did get me introduced to the idea of using linux on bare metal for a use-case that isn't a regular person doing regular person things (using an office suite, a media player, playing games, browsing the web); and, it made me better with computers, even if the end result was me being so traumatised by the experience i didn't touch linux again until 

### 5 years later.
