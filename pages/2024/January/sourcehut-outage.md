# Sourcehut seems to be down.

This isn't great, and has cemented a decision I was slowly preparing to take for a while.

## This isn't to say any of this is Sourcehut's fault;

They're not even the only intended target in this event that seems to be the largest sustained DDoS I've seen done against multiple FOSS organisations simultaneously (Codeberg was taken down, even HN was down for a short while), and I believe understanding the specifics of the attack or even any possible motivations behind something like this are beyond me.

However, what I do intend to talk about is the fact that I believe Sourcehut is doing a very good job of communicating everything that's necessary for us users to know, while doing its best to balance uptime with the load its putting on its employees (which is something a lot of software companies, especially in the videogame industry, don't do).

If Sourcehut is able to weather out this storm, I will be confident enough in the service that I will attempt to shift everything I do to it, because it matched my philosophy on software and it will also prove itself to be stable enough (unlike me).


## However, I will not port this website over to Sourcehut Pages.

In fact, the gemini capsule I have hosted using Sourcehut Pages will also be shifted away.

I've made this decision because I've seen many a internet service come up and fall down over the years, and I don't wish for anything I publish on the internet to disappear along with it, no matter how pointless or personal the stuff I write is.

However, I was lucky that the guys behind Sourcehut are seemingly as moral ("nice" is a more accurate, although less techincal, term) as they are.

### This blog is currently hosted on GitHub Pages,

And anyone with more than a single braincell's worth of memory knows what microsoft is like.

yeah, I don't want to leave my life in their hands.

So, time for the announcement:

## I'm going to self-host both this and the gemini capsule.

I'll go one step further: I'll self-host it locally, on a computer that'll be in the same room as my regular desktop computer, so that I have full control over it.


This decision isn't one that I've just made, by the way; It's been in the works for a long time, and I've slowly been collecting the hardware and the neccessary knowledge needed for achieving this. The Sourcehut outage was just a reminder that I should complete this transfer as soon as I can.
