<details class="about-me" open=""><summary> About Me </summary>
    <p> Q: Who are you? <br>A: I'm a person. A person who's passionate about most things, but good at very few. One of which happens to be working with html. </p>
    <p>Q: what are you doing here? <br>
      A: I like to write about the stuff I know. So, there'll be anywhere from zero to a bfhgillion blog entries covering useless rants about stuff that I'll probably take down in a couple of days after reading it again and realising how wrong I was when I wrote them, and lots of other unstructured content I can't think about yet.</p>
      <p>Q: what am i doing here? <br> 
      A: Well, that's for you to answer. </p>
      <p>Q: i wanna contact you, how the hell do i do that <br>
      A: just send mail to my personal gmail account <a href="mailto:newestideaz@gmail.com?subject=Hi Ash!">newestideaz@gmail.com</a> (warning: since i'm lazy and forgetful, i may not actually reply till 2-5 business days later; you have been warned.)</p>
