# Facebook is finally dying.

do you know how long i waited for it?

## But i'm not here to talk about zucc's grand plan or something.

you see, the inspiration for this article stems from a simple thing that happened today: i asked my mom if she knew about the drop in stock price and the EU thing. she said yes, and then i asked her "if facebook products die, that includes whatsapp. what will you use if whatsapp dies?"

She had no answer.

### People have become so reliant on WhatsApp that they have never even thought about alternatives.

<br>

this shouldn't have hit me in the face like a concrete wall at mach 2, but it did.

### So, I have decided to do something about it.

<br>

this is probably going to be too much effort, but i'm gonna take my parents on a tour of the entire world of instant messaging, from IRC to Signal and everything in between.

however, it's 2 AM at night and i'm sleepy, so i'll write more later.
