        <br><h1>Facebook is finally dying.</h1>

        <p> do you know how long i waited for it? </p>

        <h2> But i'm not here to talk about zucc's grand plan or something. </h2>
        <p> you see, the inspiration for this article stems from a simple thing that happened today: i asked my mom if she knew about the drop in stock price and the EU thing. she said yes, and then i asked her "if facebook products die, that includes whatsapp. what will you use if whatsapp dies?" </p>
        <p> She had no answer. </p> 
    
        <h3> People have become so reliant on WhatsApp that they have never even thought about alternatives. </h3> 
        <br><p> this shouldn't have hit me in the face like a concrete wall at mach 2, but it did.  </p>
        <h3> So, I have decided to do something about it. </h3> 
        <br><p> this is probably going to be too much effort, but i'm gonna take my parents on a tour of the entire world of instant messaging, from IRC to Signal and everything in between. </p>
  
        <br><br><br><p> however, it's 2 AM at night and i'm sleepy, so i'll write more later. </p>
