        <p>Now, for the actual post.</p>
        <p>This is my first attempt at compressing a 1080p movie, and I wasn't sure that this would work, since i've seen NVENC work much better with higher resolution video. This was a movie I was recommended to watch a long time ago, so I decided to do this one as an excuse to finally watch it. </p>
        <p>For this one, I set up HandBrake to go slightly below 7 megabits/second for an average bitrate, and set the encoder preset to slow (similar to x265 medium in my experience), and hoped for a decent reduction in file size. The original file, a raw blu-ray rip, is 21.9 GiB in size, and my compression yielded a file size of 9.25 GiB, which is less than half of the original file size.</p>
        <p>This time, I was much more confident of the quality of the video. I tested it on my 24 inch 1080p monitor at an average sitting distance of about 2 feet (or slightly under 65 centimetres for the superior metric users). I had planned comparision shots, but I couldn't do that due to unforseen circumstances, so I'll start doing that from the next release.</p>
        <p>As I had expected, the two videos are mostly indistinguishable at my selected viewing distance, with one exception near the end of the movie, where there's a nighttime scene with a lot of flowing liquid and rain (speaking any more might be a spoiler for the movie, so i'll not describe the scene any further), where there was slight blocking visible in the rain and some color distortion in the flowing liquid, which I considered to not be distracting enough to warrant an increase in bitrate.</p><br>
