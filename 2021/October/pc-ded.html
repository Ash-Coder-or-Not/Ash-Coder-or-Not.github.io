        <h1 class="h1">My PC Died :(</h1>
        <!--<p> This blog post is still under construction üèó </p>-->
        <p> So I have a prrtty shitty PC of my own, that's been serving me really well for the past 9 years; it's a Dell Inspiron (affectionately called the shitbox / the idiot box) with an old i3, 8 gigs of RAM and a hard drive with windows 10 home on it. </p>
        
        <p> now don't get me wrong, the CPU and the 8 gigs of DDR3 1600 MHz RAM can hold their own pretty well even today* <br><br>
        
        oh dear asterisk, you have tracked me down again. </p>
        
        <h4> Windows however, does not like it.</h4>
        <p> So windows 10 seems to have a ton of telemetry going on in tne background, and Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry can be found sucking up 30-50% CPU at any given time. <br>
       that's not a problem though, since there's a much bigger one:</p>
       <h4> the hard drive. </h4>
       <p> anyone who has ever used a hard drive as a boot drive knows how painful it is, and as it turns out, windows absolutely hates hard drives: it would always be stuck at 100% usage with seek times in the thousands (if not tens of thousands) of milliseconsds. running anything on that was really painful. But it was still a useful PC. it was My PC. </p>
       <p> until we had a brownout, and the PSU blew up. </p>
       <h2> This is where the problems truly begin. </h2>
       <p> so you know how it's a Dell pre-built? it's also small-form-factor, and the combination of these two led to the PSU (and the motherboard) being proprietary and not ATX/mATX/whatever.The problem with proprietary parts of any kind is that you have to go to the manufacturer for replacements. </p>
       <h4> and Dell hasn't been making this PSU model for years now </h4>
       <p> of course, I can find it on ebay, but those are overpriced and come from sellers with vrry poor credibility, to be polite. <p>
       <p> Or, I could try to buy a cheap no-name PSU (since calling the budget tight would be an understatement) and try to modify the connectors to fit thr motherboard; but the PSU would have to live outside the case of the PC, since even an expensive SFX PSU would be too big to fit inside. now that's a fire hazard waiting to happen, and I'm not very comfortable with that.</p>
       <p> one last option would be to salvage core components from the system thst are not proprietary (like the CPU, the memory and stuff) and put it into a "new" case, a "new" H61 motherboard, and a cheap PSU to build a "new" PC with my old data in it (with hopefully the SSD upgrade coming soon, though this repair eats into the budget of that a lot). <br> I prefer this over scrapping the PC and buying a new one because it'll be significantly cheaper and I don't wanna throw away parts that work just fine for what I do (which is mostly writing webpages and surfing the internet and stuff); but the hassle and risk of such a transplantation job when I'm not 100% sure that the PSU didn't take the CPU, memory and hard drive with it makes this option also slightly iffy. </p>
       <hr>
       <h4> I have to choose between three unfavourable options, </h4>
       <p> and i have no idea what to do. hopefully future me would've found a good solution and would laugh at this post thinking of the good old days when i would worry about small, irrelevant things. anyway, I have stuff to do and a ton of things to wrap up before I go to sleep, so I'll finish this post and tidy up the house. </p>
