        <p> This blog post is still under construction üèó </p>
        <!--<p> The first question: Who am I? I'm a person. A person who's not a developer. a person, who's passionate about most things, but good at very few. <br> 
        One of which happens to be working with html. </p>
        <p>The second question: what am I doing here? <br>
        Well, that's easy to answer: I like to tell people about the stuff I know. So, there'll be anywhere from zero to a couple blog entries covering useless rants about stuff that I'll probably take down in a couple of days after reading it again and realising how wrong I was when I wrote them, and lots of other unstructured content I can't think about yet.</p>
        <p>the final question: what are you doing here? Well, that's for you to answer. <br>
        I'll keep updating this post as I get an email address so that people can contact me for whatever reason.</p>
        <p>As of now, this site is still under construction. Lets's hope I can complete it as soon as possible.</p>
