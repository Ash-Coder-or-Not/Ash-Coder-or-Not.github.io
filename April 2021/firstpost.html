        <p> So, who am I? what am I doing here? what are you doing here?
        let's try to figure out answers to these questions. </p>
        <p> The first question: Who am I? I'm a person. A person who's not a developer. a person, who's passionate about most things, but good at very few. <br> 
        One of which happens to be video compression. </p>
        <p>The second question: what am I doing here? <br>
        Well, that's easy to answer: I like to tell people about the stuff I know. So since I know a thing or two about video compression, I'll use this place to teach how to compress video effectively on HandBrake (and hopefully in other programs soon), along with many examples (or case studies, whatever you wanna call it) of my style of video compression working on movies, with methods to download them. <br>
        I'll be aiming to upload one such case study every week. In between these case studies, there'll be anywhere from zero to a couple blog entries covering updates to HandBrake, useless rants about stuff that I'll probably take down in a couple of days after reading it again and realising how wrong I was when I wrote them, and lots of other unstructured content I can't think about yet.</p>
        <p>the final question: what are you doing here? Well, that's for you to answer. <br>
        I'll keep updating this post as I get an email address sp that people can contact me to recommend me movies I should try my niche style of compression on, and with other stuff that might happen in the future.</p>
        <p>As of now, this site is still under construction. Lets's hope I can complete it as soon as possible.</p>
