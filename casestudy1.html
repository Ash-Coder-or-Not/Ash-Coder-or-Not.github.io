        My compressed version: <button class="button button1" onclick="window.location.href='magnet:?xt=urn:btih:R3HR47AXKWDOFQDX4EB7E5RDD24ARIIG&dn=The%20Ten%20Commandments&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce';"> Compressed </button><br></p><br>
        <p>Now, for the actual post.</p>
        <p>This is my first serious attempt at compression, as a person I knew wanted this one for his 4k TV with surround sound included, but didn’t want to download the 80-90 gigs of raw video data for it. </p>
        <p>For this one, I set up HandBrake to go for a 20 megabits/second average bitrate, and set the encoder preset to slow (similar to x265 medium in my experience), and hoped for a decent reduction in file size. The original file is 84.4 GiB in size, and my compression yielded a file size of 40.3 GiB, which is less than half of the original file size.</p>
        <p>But with such a low bitrate, surely the video must be blocky, right? That’s what I had though going into this when I entered 20 megabits/second instead of a more reasonable value like 25 megabits/second, but when I tested it on my 4k TV, the two files looked astonishingly similar at a distance of 3 feet and beyond (to me and to others who live with me). So, what gives?</p>
        <p>Obviously, I’m not a smart person, but since I’ve only worked with 30 and 60 fps files before this, the bitrate requirements I think are minimum might be significantly higher than the minimum bitrate that makes it look indistinguishable at normal viewing distances. In fact, when you compensate for the difference in average framerate (30 vs 23.976), you get an optimum bitrate of 19.98 megabits/second, similar to what I used.</p>
        <p>I’ll see how low I can go with future releases, but this is enough for this one.</p><br>
